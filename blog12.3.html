                            Hello my name is Professor Um and throughout this Fall semester I will be teaching you some of the basic concepts of Web
                            Development. My hope is that after this course you will have the knowledge to create beautiful responsive websites of 
                            your own. The first week will be an introductory week, after that we will be diving straight into most of the topics needed
                            as a future web developer. As we are still in a global pandemic (COVID-19), I will be doing
                            asynchronous lectures presenting some basic concepts in HTML and CSS. In addition to these lectures, there will be 
                            Youtube videos supplied as supplemental information on the topics discussed in lecture. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This class will consist of 5 grade components. Quizzes, Labs, Projects, Midterm, and the Final. Quizzes will be given weekly,
                            these quizzes will contain topics that were discussed that week. These quizzes are not meant to be hard, but they will not be
                            easy for those who do not pay attention or take the time to learn concepts on their own. Small labs will be held every class
                            session, these labs will be completed in groups and will help solidify the lecture topics of the week. There will be 2 projects. 
                            The first project will be a simple Web Page; the website need not have Javascript functioniality, although that would lead to
                            some extra points. The second project will be a final summation of all the topics discussed throughout the course. Students will
                            create a clean responsive website using data from their own database. In addition to this, all functioniality will be completed
                            in Javascript when necessary. Failure to do any of these main components will result in grade reductions. The Midterm will consist
                            of 10 questions, testing your knowledge on any topics before the Midterm date. Finally, the Final will consist of 15 questions, that
                            will test your knowledge on any topic discussed throughout the course.
                        </p>

                            CS 347 was an extremely useful class. As an aspiring Front-end Software Engineer, the concepts learned to create clean and
                            responsive websites were extremely helpful. The most helpful part of the course were the labs. The labs really gave us students
                            a hands on experience with the topics we were learning. However, the labs did scale a little roughly. The starting labs were
                            very easy to follow and complete correctly. Towards the end of the semester, the labs became extremely complicated and difficult 
                            to complete fully in the time we were given. This often lead to confusion and a lesser understanding of the topics at hand. To
                            supplment this issue, I think it would be wise to give students links to helpful videos that discuss similar topics. There were
                            times during the semester where lecture videos did not provide enough information to understand or complete a lab. During these times,
                            Youtube videos became a student's best friend.
