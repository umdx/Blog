                        <div class="underline"></div>
                        <p>     The article I read this week discussed ways to optimize the
                            online food ordering experience. Specifically, "How might we
                            redesign the interface of DoorDash mobile App to 
                            optimize the food ordering experience." I chose this topic as
                            it pertained to me personally. My sister is a Software Engineer
                            at DoorDash and I thought it would be interesting to see what 
                            others thought could be improved in her team's work.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                                The article tackled the problem that most app users 
                            indicated that they couldn't find restaurants and 
                            food items easily and quickly.
                                The author broke the above problem into Part A and B.
                            In Part A, the author discusses ways to effectively solve
                            DoorDash's inefficient app restaurant browsing experience.
                            The following are the main aspects the author thought could
                            be improved: personalizing restaurant display, prioritizing 
                            user needs, and unifying visual elements on restaurant cards.
                            In Part B, the author addresses the low can-ability of the 
                            restaurant menu itself. A solution to this would be
                            redesigning information architecture and the visual content of
                            menu items. Some key take aways were as follows: a good menu
                            utilizes both visual and verbal content, and a short description
                            of the food item can help the user make a faster decision.

                        <p>
                            In the Tech Industry, developers rarely get enough time to truly
                            understand every line of code that is being reviewed or read. It is 
                            more common practice that devlopers ponder different situations in which
                            the piece of code might fail. With this all in mind, there are certain
                            practices and tips that one cane use while designing to help write better code
                            and allow for easier understanding.
                        </p>
                            In this article, by Nirmalya Ghosh, there are helpful tips that all React
                            developers can benefit from. Tip #1: "Always use prop-types to define all the
                            props in your components." Tip #2: "Use displayName to define a particular name
                            to your component." Tip #3: "Use a linter to make your code easier to review."
                            Tip #4: "Review your own code before creating a pull request".Tip #5: "Split your code into multiple smaller functions".
                            This tip is especially important as splitting bigger functions into multiple smaller ones
                            will make the smaller functions more reusable throughout the code. Tip #6: "
                            Create multiple files instead of writing a big file". This is another important tip, 
                            reviewing one large file is always harder and more confusing than reviewing multiple
                            smaller files. Tip #7: "Be very careful while naming your files". Tip #8: "
                            Always write tests for your code". This tip may seem straight forward, but it is more common
                            than not. Always indentify or look for cases in which your code may fail and handle them
                            accordingly. The final tip, Tip #9: "Donâ€™t over-use the error handling lifecycle hook".
                            An example of this would be: if the logic for the fallback user interface is your
                            ErrorBoundary component, just encapsulate your component within the ErrorBoundary.
                            Ex) "ErrorBoundary>  YourComponent />/ErrorBoundary>"".
                            All these tips are good ways to write better React and Javascript code.

                        <h1 class="section-heading">New JS Features</h1>
                        <div class="underline"></div>
                        <p>
                            This weeks article is on the new ES2020 Javascript features, specifically 10 new and
                            improved specifications. The first most anticipated feature is BigInt. This new
                            implementation allows developers to have a much greater integer representation in
                            their code. To denote a BigInt, you must append every number with an n. The following
                            is a depiction of what this may look like:

                            let newNum = 100001231231230n.

                            Notice that the number newNum being initialized to has a 'n' at the end.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The second new feature in Javascript is the ability to dynamicall import files. Following this,
                            comes nullish coalescing, which is the ability to check whether a variable is either undefined
                            or null. In this case the user must use the new nullish coalescing operator which is '??'. An
                            example of its usage would be: 

                            false ?? or undefined ?? 'some truthy value';
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The features don't end there. We then have new optional chaining, a Promise.allSettled method
                            that accepts an array of Promises and only resolves when all of them are settled, a String#matchAll
                            method, a globalThis method which always refers to the global object, Module NameSpace exports,
                            Well defined for-in order, and a import.meta object created by ECMAScript.
                            With all these new implementations, Javascript has come from a young underdog language to one of the 
                            strongest, most flexible and versatile programming languages in modern times.
                        </p>
