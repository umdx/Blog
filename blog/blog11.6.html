                <div class="underline"></div>
                <p>     The article I read this week discussed ways to optimize the
                    online food ordering experience. Specifically, "How might we
                    redesign the interface of DoorDash mobile App to 
                    optimize the food ordering experience." I chose this topic as
                    it pertained to me personally. My sister is a Software Engineer
                    at DoorDash and I thought it would be interesting to see what 
                    others thought could be improved in her team's work.

                        The article tackled the problem that most app users 
                    indicated that they couldn't find restaurants and 
                    food items easily and quickly.
                        The author broke the above problem into Part A and B.
                    In Part A, the author discusses ways to effectively solve
                    DoorDash's inefficient app restaurant browsing experience.
                    The following are the main aspects the author thought could
                    be improved: personalizing restaurant display, prioritizing 
                    user needs, and unifying visual elements on restaurant cards.
                    In Part B, the author addresses the low can-ability of the 
                    restaurant menu itself. A solution to this would be
                    redesigning information architecture and the visual content of
                    menu items. Some key take aways were as follows: a good menu
                    utilizes both visual and verbal content, and a short description
                    of the food item can help the user make a faster decision.
