                    In the Tech Industry, developers rarely get enough time to truly
                    understand every line of code that is being reviewed or read. It is 
                    more common practice that devlopers ponder different situations in which
                    the piece of code might fail. With this all in mind, there are certain
                    practices and tips that one cane use while designing to help write better code
                    and allow for easier understanding.

                    In this article, by Nirmalya Ghosh, there are helpful tips that all React
                    developers can benefit from. Tip #1: "Always use prop-types to define all the
                    props in your components." Tip #2: "Use displayName to define a particular name
                    to your component." Tip #3: "Use a linter to make your code easier to review."
                    Tip #4: "Review your own code before creating a pull request".Tip #5: "Split your code into multiple smaller functions".
                    This tip is especially important as splitting bigger functions into multiple smaller ones
                    will make the smaller functions more reusable throughout the code. Tip #6: "
                    Create multiple files instead of writing a big file". This is another important tip, 
                    reviewing one large file is always harder and more confusing than reviewing multiple
                    smaller files. Tip #7: "Be very careful while naming your files". Tip #8: "
                    Always write tests for your code". This tip may seem straight forward, but it is more common
                    than not. Always indentify or look for cases in which your code may fail and handle them
                    accordingly. The final tip, Tip #9: "Donâ€™t over-use the error handling lifecycle hook".
                    An example of this would be: if the logic for the fallback user interface is your
                    ErrorBoundary component, just encapsulate your component within the ErrorBoundary.
                    Ex) "<ErrorBoundary>  <YourComponent /></ErrorBoundary>"".
                    All these tips are good ways to write better React and Javascript code.
