                        <p>
                            This weeks article is on the new ES2020 Javascript features, specifically 10 new and
                            improved specifications. The first most anticipated feature is BigInt. This new
                            implementation allows developers to have a much greater integer representation in
                            their code. To denote a BigInt, you must append every number with an n. The following
                            is a depiction of what this may look like:

                            let newNum = 100001231231230n.

                            Notice that the number newNum being initialized to has a 'n' at the end.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The second new feature in Javascript is the ability to dynamicall import files. Following this,
                            comes nullish coalescing, which is the ability to check whether a variable is either undefined
                            or null. In this case the user must use the new nullish coalescing operator which is '??'. An
                            example of its usage would be: 

                            false ?? or undefined ?? 'some truthy value';
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The features don't end there. We then have new optional chaining, a Promise.allSettled method
                            that accepts an array of Promises and only resolves when all of them are settled, a String#matchAll
                            method, a globalThis method which always refers to the global object, Module NameSpace exports,
                            Well defined for-in order, and a import.meta object created by ECMAScript.
                            With all these new implementations, Javascript has come from a young underdog language to one of the 
                            strongest, most flexible and versatile programming languages in modern times.
